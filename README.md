# advanced_stats
Advanced stats repo for testing and preparing for the Stats exam. 

Topics in the lectures:

    1. Introduction, Statistical Inference - Veron
    2. Parametric models and the Central Limit Theory - Gino
    3. Bayesian inference - Bogdan
    4. Fisherian Inference and Generalised Linear Models - Veron
    5. Survival analysis and the EM algorithm - Gino
    6. The Jacknife and the Bootstrap - Bogdan
    7. Confidence Intervals - Gino
    8. Cross validation and prediction error - Bogdan
    9. Objective Bayes Inference and MCMC - Veron
    10. Large-Scale Hypothesis Testing and False Discovery Rates - Veron, Gino, Bogdan
    11. Feature Selection and Shrinkage Methods for Regression
    12. Inference and Model Selection

Exam focus:

    1. Which question to ask the dataset;
    2. Applied methods
    3. Presentation

Main focus: 

    1. Have a goal/expectations in the beginning and see in the end if we achieve it
    2. It's good to have contrast and we need to explore different things (divide some parts)

Next steps:
1. Maybe some more descriptive stats
2. Kaplan-Meier Survival rate
2.a) Set the assumptions for what age the player is retired. 
2.b) Markov-Chain for playing next year( ex. i am 24, what is the probability that i am going to play at 25, 26 and so on, the initial probability is the survival rate given by Gino's KM)
3. Prediction Model for Market Value( PCA, Regularizations)
4. See if by incorporating the survival rate changes the model's prediction. So one model that has survival rate as a parameter and one that does not and compare between them. 
4. 

Notes from Michael:
1. Market value in log scale
