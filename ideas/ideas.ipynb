This dataset it might be good to include variables like minutes played, goals scored, assists, passes completed, tackles made, and so on, across multiple seasons or maybe just single season.\n",

    "For GLMs we can use it to relate the number of goals scored by a player to various predictors such as shots on target, position played etc with this we can understand what factors contribute most significantly to the player's scoring ability."
